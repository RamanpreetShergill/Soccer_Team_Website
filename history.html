					<h2 class="as-title-column">History</h2>	
					<ul>
						<li><h2>2014</h2></li>
						<li><p>We entered the 2014 season full of optimism, and with a newly designed logo, as both our Pro and 2nd Division teams were defending champions. However, injuries quickly made it obvious how difficult it would be to defend our titles.</p>
							<p>The Pro team had a difficult start to the campaign, but a late push saw us make the playoffs and salvage the season, but it was still disappointing to miss out on our title defence.</p>
							<p>The 2nd Division team made club history by finishing in the top 4 to clinch our first ever home playoff berth. The team managed to make it to the finals again.</p>
							<p>Now, the 2015 season is in sight and there are new reasons for optimism. There will be new blood in the club and the league, and new reasons to hope.</p>
						</li>
						<li><br></li>
						<li>
							<li><h2>2013</h2></li>
							<li><p>The 2013 campaign was an unprecedented success for the club. Both the Pro and U23 teams had fantastic playoff runs that each culminated in winning their respective divisions of the CSL. SC Waterloo is the first team in the history of the league to do this. In the 2014 season the club will be looking to strengthen its squad to defend both titles, and to finish higher in the regular season table as well.</p>
							</li>
						</li>
							<li><br></li>
						<li>
							<li><h2>2012</h2></li>
							<li><p>KW United FC, the team that entered the CSL in 2011 from a part of Canadian geography steeped in soccer, is undergoing a complete transformation for the upcoming 2012 campaign.</p>
								<p>It will be a new-look team to enter the CSL First Division following a 2011 inaugural season in the Western Section of Division Two where the team finished fourth in the standings.</p>
								<p>And it’s a name change to SC Waterloo (Region) to connect the CSL professional team with youth soccer in the neighbouring communities of Cambridge, Guelph and Stratford in addition to the twin cities of Kitchener and Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario. The new SC Waterloo sports a new logo to reflect the club’s greater regional presence.</p>
								<p>“There is some very good youth soccer being played in Waterloo and the surrounding communities and due to the interest shown in our organization last season we considered it appropriate to give promising young players easier access to our club,” said SC Waterloo’s GM Vojo Brisevac.</p>
								<p>SC Waterloo president Tony Kocis believes the new arrangement is progressive by interfacing more young players with highly competitive soccer to the benefit of player development in the region.</p>
								<p>The team will continue in the coming months to invite players showing sufficient promise to step up to the professional level for a tryout, leading to the beginning of the regular season for SC Waterloo and the CSL early May.</p>
