						<h2>JUNE 12, 2015</h2>
							<p>SC Waterloo brings professional soccer to your door step. Our players have plied their trade in great footballing nations like Spain, Scotland, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Ukraine, and even places as far away as Thailand.</p>
							<p>Now all of that quality and skill calls Waterloo Region its home. These players will entertain those of you who know that watching on the TV can’t compare to seeing it right in front of you, they will inspire young Canadian fans to grow up loving the game, and they’ll impart their experience on our homegrown talent housed in the second division team—youngsters who are taking steps to make it in the world of football themselves (some have already been on trial overseas).</p>
							<p>But just who are these guys? In a series of articles and interviews throughout the season, we’ll introduce you to our professional players one at a time. We’ll kick off our series with one of our offensive leaders, Adis Hasecic.</p>
						
						
					<h2 class="as-title-column">CLIMBING TO THE TOP</h2>
						<h2>JUNE 10, 2015</h2>
							<p>With three wins in a row, our Pro team now finds itself in 4th place in the standings. We’re still 2 points back from the league leaders, but we have a game in hand on all the teams above us. With the squad still not quite complete, this has not been an easy task, but the experience of the veteran players has proven to be enough to do the job thus far.</p>
							<p>However, our next game will see us host the high-flying Burlington SC, and this will be a challenging test of our abilities. Come out on Sunday June 14 at 7 PM to Warrior Field, and see if we can carry on our fine run of form!</p>
					
					<h2 class="as-title-column">BACK TO BACK WINS FOR SC WATERLOO</h2>
						<h2>MAY 24, 2015</h2>
							<p>On Friday night our Pro team defeated the Serbian White Eagles in a cagey encounter. While SC Waterloo had the balance of possession, chances were difficult to come by at either end. The only goal of the game came through Adis Hasecic in the second half. This was also the first match of the season for returning midfielder Vladimir Zelenbaba, who just arrived in Canada the day before. He had been playing professionally in Thailand during our offseason. We are still waiting for a couple more arrivals.</p>
							<p>On Saturday our second division team also travelled to Serbian White Eagles. We went up 1-0 in the first half through Edward Syllie, but White Eagles came back to make it a 1-1 scoreline at half. In the second half we went up again, this time through Nikola Miokovic, but White Eagles pegged us back again to make it a 2-2 full time result. Given the balance of the chances during the game, the draw was disappointing.</p>
							<p>Next week our Pro team hosts Scarborough SC while our second division team travels to Milton.</p>	
					
					<h2 class="as-title-column">SC WATERLOO DEFEATS DEFENDING CHAMPIONS</h2>
						<h2>MAY 18, 2015</h2>
							<p>On Sunday our Pro team defeated defending champions York Region Shooters (who were undefeated last season) 4-1 at Warrior Field in our season home opener. Drazen Vukovic and Adis Hasecic (who just arrived from Bosnia on Friday) each scored within the first two minutes for the early two goal lead. The teams traded another goal each before halftime (Ramon Bailey for SC Waterloo) to go into the break up 3-1. Hasecic tapped in a Vukovic rebound in the second half to make the final score line.</p>
							<p>The 2nd Division team also played Shooters at home. They went down 2-0 in the first half, before coming back with goals from Kevin Benavides and Nikola Miokovic in the second half. But Shooters found a third goal to win 3-2.</p>
							<p>Next week both teams are on the road against Serbian White Eagles in Toronto.</p>
